# brief documentation of this script
#
# relevant environment variables:
# TOP_BUILDDIR (as in automake)
# TOP_SRCDIR (as in automake)
#
# derived values: 
# TESTDIR="$TOP_SRCDIR/examples/tests"
#
# this script looks for files called "*.test" in $TESTDIR
# each line in such a file is parsed:
# * first word is location of input hex file (relative to $TESTDIR)
# * second word is the filename of an existing file (relative to $TESTDIR)
#   * if the extension is ".out" this is a positive testcase
#     the file contains lines of answer sets
#     successful termination of dlvhex is expected
#   * if the extension is ".err" this is a negative testcase
#     the file contains one line:
#     * the first word is an integer (verifying the return value of dlvhex)
#     * the remaining line is a command executed with the error output
#       if this execution succeeds (= returns 0) the test is successful
#       e.g.: [grep -q "rule.* is not strongly safe"] (without square brackets)
# * the rest of the input line are parameters used for executing dlvhex
#   e.g.: [--nofact -ra] (without square brackets)
